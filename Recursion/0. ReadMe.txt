Here are three techniques to approach recursive problems effectively:


1. IBH Method (Induction, Base Case, Hypothesis)
This method involves three steps:

Hypothesis:
Think of a hypothesis function for the problem.
Call the hypothesis function with a reduced input (e.g., n-1).

Base Case:
Identify the smallest valid input and write it as the base case.

Induction Step:
Consider how the hypothesis function works for the reduced input.
Write the code to combine the smaller solutions into the current solution, completing the induction step.



2. Input and Output Method:

This approach requires

Drawing a Choice Diagram:
Visualize the problem by creating a recursion tree to understand all possible choices at each step.

Implementation: 
Implement the recursion based on the choice diagram, ensuring all cases are handled properly.


3. Extended Input and Output Method:

This method is used when the input and output have different data types.

Drawing a Choice Diagram:
Create a recursion tree to analyze how the input transforms into the output at each step.

Implementation:
Write the recursive code considering the transformation between input and output types.
