1. DIVISORS AND PRIME FACTORIZATION: The number of positive divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization.
If a number n has the prime factorization: n = (p1^a1) x (p2^a2) x...x (pk^ak)
then the number of positive divisors of n is:  (a1+1) x (a2+1) x...x (ak+1)

2. PRIME FACTORIZATION OF N!: To find the number of divisors of N!, we first need its prime factorization. The exponents of the primes in N!
can be found using Legendre's formula, which states that the exponent of a prime p N! is: (N/p^1) + (N/p^2) + (N/p^3)...
This sum continues until 
p^k > N, at which point the terms become zero. 

Code :
for (int p : primes) {
    int exponent = 0;
    int power = p;
    while (power <= N) {
        exponent += N / power;  // Legendre's formula
        power *= p;             // Next power of p
    }
